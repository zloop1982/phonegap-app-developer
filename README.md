# PhoneGap Developer App [![Build Status][travis-ci-img]][travis-ci-url] [![bitHound Score][bithound-img]][bithound-url]

> Available in an app store near you!

## Overview

The PhoneGap Developer app is a testing utility for web developers and designers
using the PhoneGap framework. After installing the PhoneGap Developer app you
can connect to your PhoneGap desktop app to instantly view and test your project
on the device.

For more information, see [Developer App Reference Guide][3] on the PhoneGap Docs.

## Development

### Setup

The repository includes everything required to compile the app. You can get
setup by:

    $ git clone https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-developer.git
    $ cd phonegap-app-developer/
    $ npm install

### Compile and Run

The app bundles the `phonegap` npm module as a dependency. This means that
there is no need for a global installation of `phonegap` or `cordova`.
By editing the `package.json`, you can specify the exact version of `phonegap`
to compile the project.

Since a global install of the `phonegap` module is not required, we use
`npm run` scripts to compile and run the application. This allows the app's
`platforms/` and `plugins/` directories to be removed and rebuilt each time,
ensuring a consistent build using the correct PhoneGap, Cordova, platform,
and plugin versions.

The command structure is:

    $ npm run phonegap -- <command> [args]

For example, you can check the version of `phonegap`:

    $ npm run phonegap -- --version

You can compile and run iOS or Android:

    $ npm run phonegap -- run ios
    $ npm run phonegap -- run android

For developers wishing to use the platform SDKs (Xcode, Eclipse, Visual Studio),
please build once with the CLI to correctly populate the platform assets:

    $ npm run phonegap -- build <platform>

Due to a Windows npm bug, the `--` does not work. Therefore we have created
run script that will build Windows Phone 8, so it can run in Visual Studio.

    $ npm run phonegap-wp8

### Running the Tests

There are two types of test targets: the local app and served app.

#### Test the Local Application

The local application is the PhoneGap Developer App. To test the local
functionality, we build the application with mobile-spec. This allows us to
ensure that each plugin was correctly installed. Eventually, we would like
to add functional tests for the app logic.

You can run the local tests with:

    $ npm run phonegap -- run android --test
    $ npm run phonegap -- run ios --test

Again for Windows Phone, we have a run script that will build the app so it can run in
Visual Studio.

    $ npm run phonegap-wp8-test

#### Test the Served Application

The served application is the app served by the CLI. To test the server
functionality, we serve an instance of mobile-spec. We can then use the manual
and automatic tests to ensure that the server provided the correct version of
Cordova, the plugins, and the navigation logic.

You can run the served tests with:

    $ cd tests/
    $ phonegap serve
    # now connect with the latest build of the PG App

### Updating the Tests

It's as easy as a copy and paste.

1. Copy all content of `cordova-mobile-spec`
2. Paste the content into `tests/www`

On your first run of the tests, you may see some modified files. This is expected
because the test runner invoked by `--test` modifies certain files to support
our app's configuration.

### Adding Custom Plugins

If you're a developer interested in creating your own custom build of the
PhoneGap Developer App, then this section is for you!

Since the PhoneGap Developer app bundles `phonegap` as a npm dependency and
treats the `platforms/` and `plugins/` as artifacts, you'll find that it is very
easy to add your own plugins and alter other aspects of the app.

You may visit the [PhoneGap docs](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/developer-app/custom-build/ios/) for a more in-depth guide or follow the steps below.

First, [Setup](#user-content-setup) the project on your local system.

Second, edit the `config.xml` to add a custom plugin, change a preference, or
configure the app's name. You should also change the app's id to your own
unique app bundle id:

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
    <widget id="org.mycompany.phonegap.app" version="1.6.2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets" xmlns:gap="http://phonegap.com/ns/1.0">


Third, follow the [Compile and Run](#user-content-compile-and-run) section to
get the app onto your device.

If you run into any problems, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-developer/issues).

### Releases

Releases are also generated using the npm scripts:

    $ npm run release-android
    $ npm run release-ios
    $ npm run release-wp

In order to properly code-sign Android and iOS, you must setup the signing key.
This is accomplished by cloning the signing key repository and sym-linking each
platform directory with the PhoneGap Developer App repository:

    # in your development directory
    $ git clone https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-developer-keys.git

    $ cd path/to/phonegap-app-developer/
    $ ln -s /path/to/phonegap-app-developer-keys/keys/ios resources/signing/ios
    $ ln -s /path/to/phonegap-app-developer-keys/keys/android resources/signing/android
